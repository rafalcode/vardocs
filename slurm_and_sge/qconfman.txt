QCONF(1)		   Grid Engine User Commands		      QCONF(1)



NAME
       qconf - Grid Engine Queue Configuration

SYNTAX
       qconf options

DESCRIPTION
       Qconf  allows  the  system administrator to add, delete, and modify the
       current Grid Engine configuration,  including  queue  management,  host
       management,  complex management and user management.  Qconf also allows
       you to examine the current queue configuration for existing queues.

       Qconf allows the use of the backslash, '\', character at the end	 of  a
       line  to	 indicate  that the next line is a continuation of the current
       line.  When displaying settings, such as the output of one of  the  -s*
       options,	 qconf will break up long lines (lines greater than 80 charac-
       ters) into smaller lines using backslash line continuation where possi-
       ble.   Lines will only be broken up at commas or whitespace.  This fea-
       ture can be disabled by setting the SGE_SINGLE_LINE  environment	 vari-
       able.

OPTIONS
       Unless  denoted	otherwise, the following options and the corresponding
       operations are available to all users with a valid account.


       -Aattr obj_spec fname obj_instance,...
				     <add to object attributes>
	      Similar to -aattr (see below) but takes specifications  for  the
	      object  attributes  to  be  enhanced  from  file named fname. As
	      opposed to -aattr, multiple attributes can  be  enhanced.	 Their
	      specification  has  to  be  enlisted in fname following the file
	      format of the corresponding object (see  queue_conf(5)  for  the
	      queue, for example).
	      Requires root/manager privileges.

       -Acal fname		     <add calendar>
	      Adds  a  new calendar definition to the Grid Engine environment.
	      Calendars are used in Grid Engine for defining availability  and
	      unavailability  schedules	 of  queues.  The format of a calendar
	      definition is described in calendar_conf(5).

	      The calendar definition is taken from the file  fname.  Requires
	      root/ manager privileges.

       -Ackpt fname		     <add ckpt. environment>
	      Add  the	checkpointing  environment  as	defined	 in fname (see

       -Dattr obj_spec fname obj_instance,...
				     <del. from object attribs>
	      Similar  to  -dattr  (see	 below) but the definition of the list
	      attributes from which entries are to be deleted is contained  in
	      the  file named fname. As opposed to -dattr, multiple attributes
	      can be modified. Their specification has to be enlisted in fname
	      following	 the  file  format  of	the  corresponding object (see
	      queue_conf(5) for the queue, for example).
	      Requires root/manager privileges.

	      object  attributes  to  be  modified  from  file named fname. As
	      opposed to -mattr, multiple attributes can  be  modified.	 Their
	      specification  has  to  be  enlisted in fname following the file
	      format of the corresponding object (see  queue_conf(5)  for  the
	      queue, for example).
	      Requires root/manager privileges.

	      will be deleted. The file format of file must comply to the for-
	      mat specified in hostgroup(5).

       -Mrqs fname [mrqs_name]	     <modify RQS configuration>
	      Same  as	-mrqs (see below) but instead of invoking an editor to
	      modify the RQS configuration, the file fname  is	considered  to
	      contain  a  changed  configuration.  The name of the rule set in
	      fname must be the same as rqs_name. If rqs_name is not set,  all
	      rule  sets  are  overwritten  by the rule sets in fname Refer to
	      ge_resource_quota(5) for details on the RQS  configuration  for-
	      mat.  Requires root or manager privilege.

       -Mp fname		     <modify PE configuration>
	      Same  as	-mp  (see  below) but instead of invoking an editor to
	      modify the PE configuration the file fname is considered to con-
	      tain  a changed configuration.  Refer to ge_pe(5) for details on
	      the PE configuration format.  Requires root  or  manager	privi-
	      lege.

       -Mprj fname		     <modify project config.>
	      Same  as	-mprj (see below) but instead of invoking an editor to

	      contain  a  changed  configuration.   Refer  to  project(5)  for
	      details on the project configuration format.  Requires  root  or
	      manager privilege.

       -Mq fname		     <modify queue configuration>
	      Same  as	-mq  (see  below) but instead of invoking an editor to
	      modify the queue configuration the file fname is	considered  to
	      contain  a  changed  configuration.   Refer to queue_conf(5) for
	      details on the queue configuration  format.   Requires  root  or
	      manager privilege.

       -Msconf	 fname		       <modify	scheduler  configuration  from
       file>
	      The current scheduler configuration (see sched_conf(5)) is over-
	      ridden with the configuration specified in the  file.   Requires
	      root or manager privilege.

       -Mstree fname		     <modify share tree>
	      Modifies	the  definition of the share tree (see share_tree(5)).
	      The modified sharetree is read from file fname.	Requires  root
	      or manager privileges.

       -Mu fname		     <modify ACL>
	      Takes  the  user access list (ACL) defined in fname to overwrite
	      any existing ACL with the	 same  name.  See  access_list(5)  for

	      format  of  the  user  specification  is	described  in user(5).
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -Rattr obj_spec fname obj_instance,...
				     <replace object attribs>
	      Similar to -rattr (see below) but the  definition	 of  the  list
	      attributes  whose	 content  is to be replace is contained in the
	      file named fname. As opposed to -rattr, multiple attributes  can
	      be  modified.  Their  specification  has to be enlisted in fname
	      following the file  format  of  the  corresponding  object  (see
	      queue_conf(5) for the queue, for example).
	      Requires root/manager privileges.

       -aattr obj_spec attr_name val obj_instance,...
		 <add to object attributes>
	      Allows  adding  specifications  to  a  single configuration list
	      attribute in multiple instances of an object with a single  com-
	      mand.  Currently	supported objects are the queue, the host, the
	      host group, the parallel environment, the	 resource  quota  sets
	      and the checkpointing interface configuration being specified as
	      queue , exechost , hostgroup , pe , rqs  or  ckpt	 in  obj_spec.
	      For  the	obj_spec queue the obj_instance can be a cluster queue
	      name, a queue domain name or a queue instance  name.  Find  more
	      information  concerning  different  queue names in sge_types(1).
	      Depending on the type of the obj_instance this adds to the clus-
	      ter queues attribute sublist the cluster queues implicit default
	      configuration value or the queue domain configuration  value  or
	      queue  instance  configuration  value.  The queue load_thesholds
	      parameter is an example of a list	 attribute.  With  the	-aattr
	      option,  entries	can  be added to such lists, while they can be
	      deleted with -dattr, modified with  -mattr,  and	replaced  with
	      -rattr.
	      For the obj_spec rqs the obj_instance is a unique identifier for
	      a specific rule. The identifier consists of a rule-set name  and
	      either  the  number  of the rule in the list, or the name of the
	      rule, separated by a /
	      The name of the configuration attribute to be enhanced is speci-
	      fied  with  attr_name  followed by val as a name=value pair. The
	      comma separated list of object  instances	 (e.g.,	 the  list  of
	      queues) to which the changes have to be applied are specified at
	      the end of the command.
	      The following restriction applies: For the exechost  object  the
	      load_values attribute cannot be modified (see host_conf(5)).
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -acal calendar_name	     <add calendar>
	      Adds  a  new calendar definition to the Grid Engine environment.
	      Calendars are used in Grid Engine for defining availability  and
	      unavailability  schedules	 of  queues.  The format of a calendar
	      definition is described in calendar_conf(5).

	      With the calendar name given in the option argument  qconf  will
	      open  a temporary file and start up the text editor indicated by
	      the environment variable EDITOR (default editor is vi(1) if EDI-
	      TOR  is  not  set).  After  entering the calendar definition and
	      closing the editor the new calendar is  checked  and  registered
	      with ge_qmaster(8).  Requires root/manager privileges.

       -ackpt ckpt_name		     <add ckpt. environment>
	      Adds a checkpointing environment under the name ckpt_name to the
	      list of checkpointing environments maintained by Grid Engine and
	      to be usable to submit checkpointing jobs (see checkpoint(5) for
	      details on the format of	a  checkpointing  environment  defini-
	      tion).  Qconf retrieves a default checkpointing environment con-
	      figuration and executes vi(1) (or $EDITOR if the EDITOR environ-
	      ment  variable is set) to allow you to customize the checkpoint-
	      ing environment configuration. Upon exit from  the  editor,  the
	      checkpointing  environment  is  registered  with	ge_qmaster(8).
	      Requires root/manager privileges.

       -aconf host,...		     <add configuration>
	      Successively adds configurations (see ge_conf(5)) For the	 hosts
	      in  the  comma  separated	 file_list.   For each host, an editor
	      ($EDITOR indicated or vi(1)) is invoked  and  the	 configuration
	      for  the	host  can  be entered. The configuration is registered
	      with ge_qmaster(8) after saving the file and quitting  the  edi-
	      tor.
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -ae [host_template]	     <add execution host>
	      Adds  a  host  to	 the list of Grid Engine execution hosts. If a
	      queue is configured on a host this host is  automatically	 added
	      to  the Grid Engine execution host list.	Adding execution hosts
	      explicitly offers the advantage to be able to specify parameters
	      like  load  scale	 values with the registration of the execution
	      host. However, these parameters  can  be	modified  (from	 their
	      defaults)	 at any later time via the -me option described below.
	      If the host_template argument is present,	 qconf	retrieves  the
	      configuration of the specified execution host from ge_qmaster(8)
	      or a generic template otherwise.	The template is then stored in
	      a	 file  and  qconf  executes  vi(1) (or the editor indicated by
	      $EDITOR if the EDITOR environment variable is set) to change the
	      entries  in the file.  The format of the execution host specifi-
	      cation is described in host_conf(5).  When the changes are saved
	      in  the  editor and the editor is quit the new execution host is
	      registered with  ge_qmaster(8).	Requires  root/manager	privi-
	      leges.

       -ah hostname,...		     <add administrative host>
	      Adds hosts hostname to the Grid Engine trusted host list (a host
	      must be in this list to execute administrative Grid Engine  com-
	      mands,  the  sole exception to this being the execution of qconf
	      on the ge_qmaster(8) node). The default Grid Engine installation
	      procedures  usually  add all designated execution hosts (see the
	      -ae option above) to the Grid Engine trusted host list automati-
	      cally.  Requires root or manager privileges.

       -ahgrp group		     <add host group config.>
	      Adds  a  new  host group with the name specified in group.  This
	      command invokes an editor (either vi(1) or the editor  indicated
	      by  the  EDITOR environment variable).  The new host group entry
	      is registered after changing the entry and exiting  the  editor.
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -arqs [rqs_name]		     <add new RQS>
	      Adds  one or more Resource Quota Set (RQS) description under the
	      names rqs_name to the list of RQSs  maintained  by  Grid	Engine
	      (see  ge_resource_quota(5)  for  details	on the format of a RQS
	      definition).  Qconf retrieves a default  RQS  configuration  and
	      executes vi(1) (or $EDITOR if the EDITOR environment variable is
	      set) to allow you to customize the RQS configuration. Upon  exit
	      from  the	 editor,  the  RQS  is	registered with ge_qmaster(8).
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -am user,...		     <add managers>
	      Adds the indicated  users	 to  the  Grid	Engine	manager	 list.
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -ao user,...		     <add operators>
	      Adds  the	 indicated  users  to  the  Grid Engine operator list.
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -ap pe_name		     <add new PE>
	      Adds a Parallel Environment  (PE)	 description  under  the  name
	      pe_name  to  the list of PEs maintained by Grid Engine and to be
	      usable to submit parallel jobs (see ge_pe(5) for details on  the
	      format  of  a PE definition).  Qconf retrieves a default PE con-
	      figuration and executes vi(1) (or $EDITOR if the EDITOR environ-
	      ment  variable is set) to allow you to customize the PE configu-
	      ration. Upon exit from the editor, the  PE  is  registered  with
	      ge_qmaster(8).  Requires root/manager privileges.

       -at thread_name <activates thread in master>
	      Activates	  an   additional   thread   in	 the  master  process.
	      thread_name might be either "scheduler"  or  "jvm".  The	corre-
	      sponding	thread is only started when it is not already running.
	      There might be only one scheduler and only one jvm thread in the
	      master process at the same time.

       -aprj			     <add new project>
	      Adds  a  project	description to the list of registered projects
	      (see  project(5)).    Qconf   retrieves	a   template   project
	      configuration and executes vi(1) (or $EDITOR if the EDITOR envi-
	      ronment variable is set) to  allow  you  to  customize  the  new
	      project.	Upon  exit from the editor, the template is registered
	      with ge_qmaster(8).  Requires root or manager privileges.

       -aq [queue_name]		     <add new queue>
	      Qconf   retrieves	  the	default	  queue	  configuration	  (see
	      queue_conf(5))  and  executes  vi(1)  (or	 $EDITOR if the EDITOR
	      environment variable is set) to allow you to customize the queue
	      configuration.  Upon  exit  from the editor, the queue is regis-
	      tered with ge_qmaster(8).	 A minimal configuration requires only
	      that the queue name and queue hostlist be set.  Requires root or
	      manager privileges.

       -as hostname,...		     <add submit hosts>
	      Add hosts hostname to the list of hosts allowed to  submit  Grid
	      Engine  jobs  and control their behavior only.  Requires root or
	      manager privileges.

       -astnode node_path=shares,... <add share tree node>
	      Adds the specified share tree node(s) to	the  share  tree  (see
	      share_tree(5)).	 The   node_path   is	a   hierarchical  path
	      ([/]node_name[[/.]node_name...])	specifying the location of the
	      new  node	 in the share tree.  The base name of the node_path is
	      the name of the new node.	 The node is initialized to the number
	      of specified shares.  Requires root or manager privileges.

       -astree			     <add share tree>
	      Adds  the	 definition  of	 a  share  tree	 to  the  system  (see
	      share_tree(5)).  A template share tree is retrieved and an  edi-
	      tor (either vi(1) or the editor indicated by $EDITOR) is invoked
	      for modifying the share tree definition. Upon exiting  the  edi-
	      tor,   the  modified  data  is  registered  with	ge_qmaster(8).
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -Astree fname		     <add share tree>
	      Adds  the	 definition  of	 a  share  tree	 to  the  system  (see
	      share_tree(5))  from  the	 file fname.  Requires root or manager
	      privileges.

       -au user,... acl_name,...     <add users to ACLs>

	      ager/operator privileges.

       -Auser fname		     <add user>
	      Add the user defined in fname to the Grid	 Engine	 cluster.  The
	      format  of  the  user  specification  is	described  in user(5).
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -auser			     <add user>
	      Adds a user to the list of registered users (see user(5)).  This
	      command  invokes an editor (either vi(1) or the editor indicated
	      by the EDITOR environment variable) for a template user. The new
	      user is registered after changing the entry and exiting the edi-
	      tor. Requires root or manager privileges.

       -clearusage		     <clear sharetree usage>
	      Clears all user and project usage from the sharetree.  All usage
	      will be initialized back to zero.

	      Used  to shutdown Grid Engine components (daemons).  In the form
	      -km ge_qmaster(8) is forced to terminate in a  controlled	 fash-
	      ion.  In	the  same way the -ks switch causes termination of the
	      scheduler thread.	 Shutdown  of  running	ge_execd(8)  processes
	      currently	 registered is initiated by the -ke option. If -kej is
	      specified instead, all jobs running on the execution  hosts  are
	      aborted  prior  to termination of the corresponding ge_execd(8).
	      The comma separated host list specifies the execution  hosts  to
	      be  addressed  by the -ke and -kej option. If the keyword all is
	      specified instead of a host list, all running  ge_execd(8)  pro-
	      cesses  are shutdown. Job abortion, initiated by the -kej option
	      will result in dr state for all running jobs  until  ge_execd(8)
	      is running again.
	      Requires root or manager privileges.

       -kt thread_name	 <terminate master thread>"
	      Terminates  a thread in the master process. Currently it is only

	      command  will  only be successful if the corresponding thread is
	      running.

       -kec {id,...|all}	     <kill event client>
	      Used to shutdown event clients registered at ge_qmaster(8).  The
	      comma separated event client list specifies the event clients to
	      be addressed by the -kec option.	If the keyword all  is	speci-
	      fied  instead of an event client list, all running event clients
	      except special clients like the scheduler thread are terminated.
	      Requires root or manager privilege.

       -purge queue attr_nm,... obj_spec
		 <purge divergent attribute settings>
	      Delete  the values of the attributes defined in attr_nm from the
	      object defined in obj_spec. Obj_spec can be "queue_instance"  or
	      "queue_domain".	The  names  of the attributes are described in
	      queue_conf(1).
	      This operation only works on a single queue instance or  domain.
	      It  cannot  be  used  on a cluster queue.	 In the case where the
	      obj_spec is "queue@@hostgroup", the attribute values defined  in
	      attr_nm  which  are set for the indicated hostgroup are deleted,
	      but not those which are set for  the  hosts  contained  by  that
	      hostgroup.   If the attr_nm is '*', all attribute values set for
	      the given queue instance or domain are deleted.
	      The main difference between -dattr and  -purge  is  that	-dattr
	      removes  a  value	 from  a single list attribute, whereas -purge
	      removes one or more overriding attribute settings from a cluster
	      queue  configuration.   With  -purge,  the  entire  attribute is
	      deleted for the given queue instance or queue domain.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
       GE_ROOT	      Specifies	 the location of the Grid Engine standard con-
		      figuration files.

       GE_CELL	      If set, specifies	 the  default  Grid  Engine  cell.  To
		      address  a  Grid Engine cell qconf uses (in the order of
		      precedence):

			     The name of the cell specified in the environment
			     variable GE_CELL, if it is set.

			     The name of the default cell, i.e. default.


       GE_DEBUG_LEVEL If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
		      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in	 which
		      debug information is generated is defined.

       GE_QMASTER_PORT
		      If set, specifies the tcp port on which ge_qmaster(8) is
		      expected to listen  for  communication  requests.	  Most
		      installations  will  use a services map entry instead to
		      define that port.

       GE_EXECD_PORT  If set, specifies the tcp port on which  ge_execd(8)  is
		      expected	to  listen  for	 communication requests.  Most
		      installations will use a services map entry  instead  to
		      define that port.

       SGE_SINGLE_LINE
		      If  set,	indicates that long lines should not be broken
		      up  using	 backslashes.	This  setting  is  useful  for
		      scripts which expect one entry per line.

RESTRICTIONS
       Modifications  to  a queue configuration do not affect an active queue,
       taking effect on next invocation of the queue (i.e., the next job).
