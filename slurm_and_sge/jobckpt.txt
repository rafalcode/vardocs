     [52]File System Requirements for Checkpointing

User-Level Checkpointing

   Many application programs, especially programs that consume
   considerable CPU time, use checkpointing and restart mechanisms to
   increase fault tolerance. Status information and important parts of the
   processed data are repeatedly written to one or more files at certain
   stages of the algorithm. If the application is aborted, these restart
   files can be processed and restarted at a later time. The files reach a
   consistent state that is comparable to the situation just before the
   checkpoint. Because the user mostly has to move the restart files to a
   proper location, this kind of checkpointing is called user-level
   checkpointing.

   Application programs that do not have integrated user-level
   checkpointing can use a checkpointing library. A checkpointing library
   can be provided by some hardware vendors or by the public domain. The
   Condor project of the University of Wisconsin is an example. By
   relinking an application with such a library, a checkpointing mechanism
   is installed in the application without requiring source code changes.

Kernel-Level Checkpointing

   Some operating systems provide checkpointing support inside the
   operating system kernel. No preparations in the application programs
   and no relinking of the application is necessary in this case.
   Kernel-level checkpointing usually applies to single processes as well
   as to complete process hierarchies. A hierarchy of interdependent
   processes can be checkpointed and restarted at any time. Usually both a
   user command and a C library interface are available to initiate a
   checkpoint.

   The Grid Engine system supports operating system checkpointing if
   available. See the release notes for the Sun Grid Engine software for
   information about the currently supported kernel-level checkpointing
   facilities.

Migrating Checkpointing Jobs

   Checkpointing jobs are interruptible at any time because their restart
   capability ensures that very little work that is already done must be
   repeated. This ability is used to build migration and dynamic load
   balancing mechanism in the Grid Engine system. If requested,
   checkpointing jobs are stopped on demand. The jobs are migrated to
   other machines in the Grid Engine system, thus averaging the load in
   the cluster dynamically. Checkpointing jobs are stopped and migrated
   for the following reasons:
     * The executing queue or the job is suspended explicitly by a qmod or
       a QMON command.
     * The job or the queue where the job runs is suspended automatically
       because a suspend threshold for the queue is exceeded. The
       checkpoint occasion specification for the job includes the
       suspension case. For more information, see [53]How to Configure
       Load and Suspend Thresholds and [54]How to Submit, Monitor, or
       Delete a Checkpointing Job.

   A migrating job moves back to sge_qmaster. The job is subsequently
   dispatched to another suitable queue if such a queue is available. In
   such a case, the qstat output shows R as the status.

Composing a Checkpointing Job Script

   Shell scripts for kernel-level checkpointing are the same as regular
   shell scripts.

   Shell scripts for user-level checkpointing jobs differ from regular
   batch scripts only in their ability to properly handle the restart
   process. The environment variable RESTARTED is set for checkpointing
   jobs that are restarted. Use this variable to skip sections of the job
   script that need to be executed only during the initial invocation.

   The following example shows a sample transparently checkpointing job
   script.

Example – Checkpointing Job Script

#!/bin/sh
#Force /bin/sh in Grid Engine
#$ -S /bin/sh

# Test if restarted/migrated
if [ $RESTARTED = 0 ]; then
     # 0 = not restarted
     # Parts to be executed only during the first
     # start go in here
     set_up_grid
fi

# Start the checkpointing executable
fem
#End of scriptfile

   The job script restarts from the beginning if a user-level
   checkpointing job is migrated. The user is responsible for directing
   the program flow of the shell script to the location where the job was
   interrupted. Doing so skips those lines in the script that must be
   executed more than once.
   Note
   Kernel-level checkpointing jobs are interruptible at any time. The
   embracing shell script is restarted exactly from the point where the
   last checkpoint occurred. Therefore, the RESTARTED environment variable
   is not relevant for kernel-level checkpointing jobs.

How to Submit a Checkpointing Job With QMON

   The submission of checkpointing jobs With QMON is identical to
   submitting regular batch jobs, with the addition of specifying an
   appropriate checkpointing environment. As explained in [55]How to
   Submit Advanced Jobs With QMON, the Submit Job dialog box provides a
   field for the checkpointing environment that is associated with a job.
   Click the button next to that field to open the following Selection
   dialog box.
   "Dialog box titled Select an Item. Shows Ok

   You can select a suitable checkpoint environment from the list of
   available checkpoint objects. Ask your system administrator for
   information about the properties of the checkpointing environments that
   are installed at your site. For more information, refer to [56]Managing
   Checkpointing Environments.

How to Submit, Monitor, or Delete a Checkpointing Job From the Command Line

   Type the following command with the appropriate options:
# qsub <options> <arguments>

   The submission of a checkpointing job works in the same way as for
   regular batch scripts, except for the qsub -ckpt and qsub -c commands.
   These commands request a checkpointing mechanism. The commands also
   define the occasions at which checkpoints must be generated for the
   job.

   The -ckpt option takes one argument, which is the name of the
   checkpointing environment to use. See [57]Managing Checkpointing
   Environments.

   The -c option is not required. -c also takes one argument. Use the -c
   option to override the definitions of the when parameter in the
   checkpointing environment configuration. See the checkpoint(5) man page
   for details.

   The argument to the -c option can be one of the following one-letter
   selections, or any combination. The argument can also be a time value.
     * n – No checkpoint is performed. n has the highest precedence.
     * s – A checkpoint is generated only if the sge_execd on the jobs
       host is shut down.
     * m – Generate the checkpoint at the minimum CPU interval defined in
       the corresponding queue configuration. See the min_cpu_interval
       parameter in the queue_conf(5) man page.
     * x – A checkpoint is generated if the job is suspended.
     * interval – Generate the checkpoint in the given interval but not
       more frequently than defined by min_cpu_interval. The time value
       must be specified as hh:mm:ss. This format specifies two digit
       hours, minutes, and seconds, separated by colons.

   The monitoring of checkpointing jobs differs from monitoring regular
   jobs. Checkpointing jobs can migrate from time to time. Checkpointing
   jobs are therefore not bound to a single queue. However, the unique job
   identification number and the job name stay the same.

   The deletion of checkpointing jobs works in the same way as described
   in [58]Monitoring and Controlling Jobs From the Command Line.

File System Requirements for Checkpointing

   When a user-level checkpoint or a kernel-level checkpoint that is based
   on a checkpointing library is written, a complete image of the virtual
   memory covered by the process or job to be checkpointed must be saved.
   Sufficient disk space must be available for this purpose. If the
   checkpointing environment configuration parameter ckpt_dir is set, the
   checkpoint information is saved to a job private location under
   ckpt_dir. If ckpt_dir is set to NONE, the directory where the
   checkpointing job started is used. See the checkpoint(5) man page for
   detailed information about the checkpointing environment configuration.
   Note
   You should start a checkpointing job with the qsub -cwd script if
   ckpt_dir is set to NONE.

   Checkpointing files and restart files must be visible on all machines
   in order to successfully migrate and restart jobs. Because file
   visibility is necessary for the way file systems must be organized, NFS
   or a similar file system is required. Ask your cluster administration
   if your site meets this requirement.

   If your site does not run NFS, you can transfer the restart files
   explicitly at the beginning of your shell script. For example, you can
   use rcp or ftp in the case of user-level checkpointing jobs.
