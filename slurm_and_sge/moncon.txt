            Finished Jobs tab.
          + To refresh the Job Control display, click the Refresh button
            to force an update. QMON then uses a polling scheme to
            retrieve the status of the jobs from sge_qmaster.
          + To modify job attributes, select a pending or running job and
            then click the Qalter button. For more information, see
            How to Modify Job Attributes.
          + To change job priority, select a pending or running job and
            then press the Priority button. For more information, see
            How to Change Job Priority.
          + To put a job or an array task on hold, select a pending job
            and then press the Hold button. For more information, see
            How to Put Jobs and Array Job Tasks on Hold.
          + To force a job, first select a pending job or running job,
            next select the Force option and then click the Suspend,
            Resume, or Delete buttons. For more information, see How
            to Force Jobs.
          + To verify job consistency, select a pending job and then click
            the Qalter button. For more information, see How to Verify
            Job Consistency.

            button. For more information, see How to Customize the Job
            Control Display.

How to Modify Job Attributes

    1. Click a pending or running job on the and Job Control dialog box
       and then click the Qalter button.
       The Submit Job dialog box appears. All the entries of the dialog
       box correspond to the attributes of the job that were defined when
       the job was submitted.

   Note
   Entries that cannot be changed are grayed out.
    2. Edit available entries appropriately.
    3. Click the Qalter button, a substitute for the Submit button on the
       Submit Job dialog box, to register changes with the Grid Engine
       system.

How to Change Job Priority

    1. Select a pending or running job on the Job Control dialog box and
       then click the Priority button.
       The priority dialog box appears, as shown below. This dialog box
       enables you to change the priority of selected pending or running
       jobs. The priority ranks a single user's jobs among themselves.
       Priority tells the scheduler how to choose among a single user's
       jobs when several jobs are in the system simultaneously.
       "Dialog box titled "Enter an Integer. Shows a field for typing a
       number for job priority. Shows OK
    2. Enter a new priority for the selected job(s) in the field and then
       click OK.

How to Put Jobs and Array Job Tasks on Hold

   As long as any hold is assigned to a job or an array job task, the job
   or array job task is not eligible for running.
   Note
   User holds can be set or reset by the job owner as well as by Grid
   Engine managers and operators. Operator holds can be set or reset by
   managers and operators. System holds can be set or reset by managers
   only. You can also set or reset holds by using the qalter, qhold, and
   qrls commands.

     * To put a job on hold, select a pending job from the Job Control
       Dialog dialog box, shown above, and click Hold.
       The Set Hold dialog box appears. The Set Hold dialog box enables
       you to set and reset user, operator, and system holds.
     * To put an array task on hold, do the following:
         1. Select a pending job from the Job Control dialog box and click
            Hold.
            The Set Hold dialog box appears.
         2. Use the Tasks field to put a hold on particular subtasks of an
            array job.
            The task ID range specified in this field can be a single
            number, a simple range of the form n-m, or a range with a step
            size. For example, the task ID range specified by 2-10:2
            results in the task ID indexes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. This range
            represents a total of five identical tasks, with the
            environment variable SGE_TASK_ID containing one of the five
            index numbers. For detailed information about job holds, see
            the qsub(1) man page.

How to Force Jobs

   Only running jobs can be suspended or resumed. Only pending jobs can be
   rescheduled, held back and modified, in priority as well as in other
   attributes.
    1. To force jobs, select a job from the Pending Jobs tab or the
       Running Jobs tab and then select the Force option.
    2. Click the Suspend, Resume, or Delete buttons.

   Note
   You can force suspending, resuming, and deleting jobs. In other words,
   you can register these actions with sge_qmaster without notifying the
   sge_execd that controls the jobs. Forcing is useful when the
   corresponding sge_execd is unreachable, for example, due to network
   problems.

   Suspension of a job sends the signal SIGSTOP to the process group of
   the job with the UNIX kill command. SIGSTOP halts the job and no longer
   consumes CPU time. Resumption of the job sends the signal SIGCONT,
   thereby unsuspending the job. See the kill(1) man page for your system
   for more information on signaling processes.

How to Verify Job Consistency

   Note
   The Verify flag on the Submit Job dialog box has a special meaning when
   the flag is used in the Qalter mode. You can check pending jobs for
   consistency, and you can investigate why jobs are not yet scheduled.
    1. Select a pending job from the Job Control dialog box and and click
       the Qalter button.
    2. Click the Advanced tab.
    3. Select the desired consistency-checking mode for the Verify flag,
       and then click Qalter.

   Note
   The system displays warnings on inconsistencies, depending on the
   checking mode you select. See How to Submit Advanced Jobs With QMON
   and the -w option on the qalter(1) man page for more information.

How to Use the Why? Button to Get Information About Pending Jobs

   Note
   The Why? button delivers meaningful output only if the scheduler
   configuration parameter schedd_job_info is set to true. See the
   sched_conf(5) man page.

   To get information about pending jobs, select a pending job from the
   Job Control dialog box and click the Why? button.
   The Object Browser dialog box appears. As shown below, this dialog box
   displays a list of reasons that prevented the scheduler from
   dispatching the job in its most recent pass.
   Note
   The displayed scheduler information relates to the last scheduling
   interval. The information might not be accurate by the time you
   investigate why your job was not scheduled.

   "Dialog box titled Browser. Shows scheduling information. Shows stdout

How to Clear Error States

   To clear error states, select a pending job from the Job Control dialog
   box and then click the Clear Error button.
   This removes an error state from a pending job that failed due to a
   job-dependent problem. For example, the job might have insufficient
   permissions to write to the specified job output file.

   Error states appear in red text in the pending jobs list. You should
   remove jobs only after you correct the error condition, for example,
   using qalter. Such error conditions are automatically reported through
   email if the job requests to send email when the job is aborted. For
   example, the job might have been aborted with the qsub -m a command.

How to Filter the Job List

    1. Click the Customize button in the Job Control dialog box.
       The Job Customize box appears, as shown below.
    2. Click the Filter Jobs tab.
    Example - Filtering the Job List
       The following example of the filtering facility selects only jobs
       that are suitable to be run on the architecture solaris64.
       Dialog box titled Job Customize. Shows the Filter Jobs tab with a
       list of filter resources and a list of available resources.
       The following figure shows the resulting Running Jobs tab of the
       Job Control dialog box.
       Dialog box titled Job Customize. Shows the Filter Jobs tab with a
       list of filter resources and a list of available resources.
       The Job Control dialog box that is shown in the previous figure is
       also an example of how QMON displays array jobs.

How to Customize the Job Control Display

    1. Click the Customize button on the Job Control dialog box.
       The Job Customize dialog box appears.
    2. Click the Select Job Fields tab.
       A sample Select Job Fields tab is shown in the following figure.
       Dialog box titled Job Customize. Shows the Select Jobs Field tab
       with a list of available fields and a list of selected fields.
    3. Use the Job Customize dialog box to configure the set of
       information to display.
       You can select more entries of the job object to be displayed.
    4. Use the Save button on the Job Customize dialog box to store the
       customizations in the file .qmon_preferences.
       This file is located in the user's home directory. By saving your
       customizations, you redefine the appearance of the Job Control
       dialog box.

How to Get Additional Information About Jobs With the QMON Object Browser

   You can use the QMON Object Browser to quickly retrieve additional
   information about jobs without having to customize the Job Control
   dialog box, as explained in Monitoring and Controlling Jobs With
   QMON.

   To display information about jobs using the Object Browser, use one of
   the following methods:
     * From the Job Control dialog box, move the pointer over a job name.
     * From the Browser dialog box, click Job.

Monitoring and Controlling Jobs From the Command Line

How to Monitor Jobs With qstat

   The three primary ways to use the qstat command to monitor jobs are as
   follows:
     * qstat – Without options, this command will only display a list of
       jobs with no queue status information. The purpose of most of the
       columns should be self-explanatory. The state column, however,
       contains single character codes with the following meaning: r for
       running, s for suspended, q for queued, and w for waiting.
     * qstat -f – This command causes summary information on all queues to
       be displayed, along with the queued job list.
       The display is divided into the following two sections:
          + Available Queues - This section displays the status of all
            available queues. The first line of the queue section defines
            the meaning of the columns with respect to the queues that are
            listed. The queues are separated by horizontal lines. If jobs
            run in a queue, the job names appear below the associated
            queue in the same format as in the qstat command in its first
            form. The columns of the queue description provide the
            following information:
               o qtype – Queue type. Queue type is either B (batch) or I
                 (interactive).
               o used/free – Count of used and free job slots in the
                 queue.
               o states – State of the queue. See the qstat(1) man page
                 for detailed information about queue states.
          + Pending Jobs – This section shows the status of the
            sge_qmaster job spool area. The pending jobs in the second
            output section are also listed as in qstat`s first form.
     * qstat -ext – This command contains details such as up-to-date job
       usage and tickets assigned to a job.

   The following information is displayed:
     *
          + The usage and ticket values assigned to a job, shown in the
            following columns:
               o cpu/mem/io – Currently accumulated CPU, memory, and I/O
                 usage.
               o tckts – Total number of tickets assigned to the job.
               o ovrts – Override tickets assigned through qalter -ot.
               o otckt – Tickets assigned through the override policy.
               o ftckt – Tickets assigned through the functional policy.
               o stckt – Tickets assigned through the share-based policy.
               o Share - Current Resource share that each job has with
                 respect to the usage generated by all jobs in the
                 cluster.
          + The deadline initiation time in the column deadline, if
            applicable.

   Additional options to the qstat command enhance the functionality. Use
   the -r option to display the resource requirements of submitted jobs.
   Furthermore, the output can be restricted to a certain user or to a
   specific queue. You can use the -l option to specify resource
   requirements, as described in Defining Resource Requirements, for
   the qsub command. If resource requirements are used, only those queues,
   and the jobs that are running in those queues, are displayed that match
   the resource requirement specified by qstat.
   Note
   The qstat command has been enhanced so that the administrator and the
   user may define files that can contain useful options. See the
   sge_qstat(5) man page. A cluster-wide sge_qstat file may be placed
   under $xxQS_NAME_Sxx_ROOT/$xxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL/common/sge_qstat. The
   user private file is processed under the location $HOME/.sge_qstat. The
   home directory request file has the highest precedence, then the
   cluster global file. You can use the command line to override the flags
   contained in a file.

   See the qstat(1) man page for a detailed explanation of the qstat
   output format.

   The following examples show output from the qstat and qstat -f
   commands.

How to Control Jobs With qdel and qmod

   To control jobs from the command line, type one of the following
   commands with the appropriate arguments.
% qdel <arguments>
% qmod <arguments>

   Use the qdel command to delete jobs, regardless of whether the jobs are
   running or are spooled. Use the qmod command to suspend and resume
   (unsuspend) jobs already running.

   For both commands, you need to know the job identification number,
   which is displayed in response to a successful qsub command. If you
   forget the number, you can retrieve it with qstat. See Monitoring
   Jobs With qstat.

   The following list provides several examples of the qdel and qmod
   commands:
% qdel <job-id>
% qdel -f <job-id1>, <job-id2>
% qmod -s <job-id>
% qmod -us -f <job-id1>, <job-id2>
% qmod -s <job-id.task-id-range>

   In order to delete, suspend, or resume a job, you must be the owner of
   the job or a Grid Engine manager or operator. See Managers,
   Operators, and Owners.

   You can use the -f (force) option with both commands to register a job
   status change at sge_qmaster without contacting sge_execd. You might
   want to use the force option in cases where sge_execd is unreachable,
   for example, due to network problems. The -f option is intended for use
   only by the administrator. In the case of qdel, however, users can
   force deletion of their own jobs if the flag ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL in the
   cluster configuration qmaster_params entry is set. See the sge_conf(5)
   man page for more information.

Monitoring and Controlling Jobs by Email

How to Monitor Jobs by Email

   From the command line, type the following command with appropriate
   arguments.
% qsub <arguments>

   The qsub -m command requests email to be sent to the user who submitted
   a job or to the email addresses specified by the -M flag if certain
   events occur. See the qsub(1) man page for a description of the flags.
   An argument to the -m option specifies the events. The following
   arguments are available:
     * b – Send email at the beginning of the job.
     * e – Send email at the end of the job.
     * a – Send email when the job is rescheduled or aborted For example,
       by using the qdel command.
     * s – Send email when the job is suspended.
     * n – Do not send email. n is the default.

   Use a string made up of one or more of the letter arguments to specify
   several of these options with a single -m option. For example, -m be
   sends email at the beginning and at the end of a job.

   You can also use QMON's Submit Job dialog box to configure these mail
   events. See How to Submit Advanced Jobs With QMON.
